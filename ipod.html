            <h2>The iPod Revolution</h2>
            <p>Introduced by Steve Jobs on October 23, 2001, the iPod transformed how we listen to music. With its innovative scroll wheel and simple interface, it made digital music accessible to everyone. The iconic phrase "1,000 songs in your pocket" captured the revolutionary storage capacity that was unprecedented for a portable device of its size.</p>

                <figcaption>iTunes revolutionized how music was purchased, organized, and listened to</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Launched in 2001, iTunes became the perfect companion for the iPod. The iTunes Store, introduced in 2003, created a legal digital marketplace for music at a time when piracy was rampant. With its 99-cent per song model, it forever changed the music industry, moving consumers away from albums to individual tracks. iTunes eventually expanded to include podcasts, TV shows, movies, and more.</p>

                <figcaption>Apple Music replaced the iPod and iTunes ecosystem with streaming-first approach</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>As smartphone adoption grew and streaming services gained popularity, the iPod's relevance began to fade. With the iPhone offering all iPod functionality plus communications, the dedicated music player became less essential. In 2015, Apple launched Apple Music, its subscription-based streaming service, signaling a shift from ownership to access. iTunes was gradually phased out in 2019, split into separate Music, TV, and Podcast apps. The final iPod (the iPod Touch) was discontinued in May 2022, marking the end of an iconic product line that had transformed both Apple and the music industry.</p>

            <h2>iPod's Legacy</h2>
            <p>Though no longer produced, the iPod's influence remains evident in modern technology. It helped transform Apple from a computer company into a consumer electronics giant, paving the way for the iPhone and iPad. Its simple interface philosophy—making complex technology accessible through thoughtful design—remains central to Apple's approach. The iPod's white earbuds became a cultural icon, and its advertising campaigns featuring silhouetted dancers against colorful backgrounds are still instantly recognizable. Most importantly, the iPod forever changed how we consume music, making the shift to digital and mobile listening possible.</p>
