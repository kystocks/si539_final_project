            <h2>A Revolutionary Introduction</h2>
            <p>On January 9, 2007, Steve Jobs took the stage at Macworld and announced: "Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone." He introduced three revolutionary products: a widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet communicator. Then came the reveal—these weren't three separate devices but one: the iPhone. With its multi-touch interface, full web browser, and app ecosystem, the iPhone fundamentally redefined not just mobile phones but computing itself.</p>

            <h2>The iOS Evolution</h2>

            </figure>
            <p>Initially called iPhone OS, the iPhone's operating system has undergone a remarkable evolution. The original iPhone didn't even support third-party apps—a feature added in iPhone OS 2 with the App Store launch in 2008. Over the years, iOS has introduced transformative features like multitasking, notification center, control center, and widgets. The visual design saw a dramatic shift with iOS 7 in 2013, moving from skeuomorphic designs to a flatter, more modern aesthetic. Each iOS version has expanded capabilities while maintaining the intuitive user experience that made the original iPhone revolutionary. Today's iOS includes sophisticated features like app privacy reports, focus modes, and deep integration with other Apple devices.</p>

            <h2>The App Revolution</h2>

                <figcaption>The App Store created an entire economy of mobile software development</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>When Steve Jobs initially resisted third-party apps, preferring web applications, few could have predicted the eventual impact of the App Store. Launched in 2008 with just 500 apps, it grew into a global marketplace with millions of applications that transformed countless industries. The app economy has created millions of jobs worldwide and generated hundreds of billions in revenue. Apps have changed how we communicate (WhatsApp, Instagram), how we travel (Uber, Google Maps), how we shop (Amazon, mobile banking), and even how we date (Tinder, Bumble). The iPhone's combination of powerful hardware, user-friendly interface, and robust development platform made it the perfect catalyst for this app revolution.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Impact</h2>
            <p>The iPhone has reshaped culture in profound ways. It transformed photography by making cameras accessible at all times, leading to the rise of social media platforms like Instagram. It changed how we consume content, shifting from desktop websites to mobile apps and making media consumption an anytime, anywhere activity. The iPhone altered social norms around availability, creating expectations of constant connectivity. It even changed physical behavior—the "head down" posture of people checking their phones became a defining image of modern life. From "there's an app for that" to "shot on iPhone," the device's advertising campaigns have entered the cultural lexicon, while the annual iPhone announcement event has become a global media spectacle.</p>
